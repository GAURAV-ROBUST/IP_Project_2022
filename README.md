**Why this Project?**
**Today we are continuously hearing about growth in Crime rates and the number of murders executed day by day.It is very unfortunate that we are living in the country known as the hub of criminals. About 3.5 lakhs crimes have been committed in just 12 years from 2001 to 2012. This is the most in any country ever recorded.
